ðŸ§  Epileptic Seizure Detection using CNN
Description
This project utilizes a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify epileptic seizures from EEG (electroencephalogram) time-series data. The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the "Epileptic Seizure Recognition" dataset to distinguish between seizure and non-seizure activity, achieving high accuracy in detection.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/iamaryannnn/Epileptic_Seizure_Detection_using_CNN.git
cd your-repository

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow

Usage
You can run the project using the provided Jupyter Notebook (EPILEPTIC_SEIZURE_CNN.ipynb).

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open EPILEPTIC_SEIZURE_CNN.ipynb.

Make sure to update the file path in the notebook to point to your local copy of the dataset:

# Update this path in Step 2 of the notebook
file_path = r"path/to/your/Epileptic Seizure Recognition.csv"

Run the cells sequentially to load the data, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

Dataset
The model is trained on the "Epileptic Seizure Recognition" dataset. This dataset contains 11,500 samples of EEG recordings, each with 178 data points representing a one-second time window. The target variable y indicates the presence of a seizure (1) or its absence (0).

Model Architecture
The model is a Sequential 1D CNN built with Keras:
